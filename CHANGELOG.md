## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-30

### Changed
- **Re-signed with plugin envelope v2** (MOB-287). mob_dev 0.7.2+ verifies
  this signature before evaluating the manifest. mob_dev 0.7.0 / 0.7.1 can't
  read v2 signatures and report this release as `invalid signature` —
  upgrade the host app to `{:mob_dev, "~> 0.7.2", only: :dev, runtime: false}`.
  No plugin code changes.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-16

### Changed
- Signed release: the published package now carries a verified Ed25519
  signature (shared mob first-party key, regenerated in CI on every
  release). Generated apps trust it via `config :mob, :trusted_plugins`,
  so it clears the plugin signature gate without `acknowledge_unsafe_plugins`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

Initial release. System photo/video library picker for Mob apps.

- `MobPhotos.pick/2` opens the OS photo picker and returns the chosen media.
- Extracted from mob core in the 0.7.0 plugin-extraction wave.
- Requires `mob ~> 0.7`.
